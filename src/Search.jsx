                                            a chain of events is set in motion in the virtual space. The chain of events that is set in motion to throw up search
                                            results is at the heart of search engine optimization (SEO).

                                             SEO is a technique search engines use to sift through the myriad of information available on the web to present the most
                                            relevant topics related to the search query. It recognizes the words present in the query and seeks out pieces of
                                            information that hold these words. The search engine is optimizing results that match the query. Businesses use SEO as a
                                            powerful tool to drive traffic to their websites to increase their opportunities to convert traffic into sales.

                        Fundamental to SEO is keyword research. We interact with you to understand your business and identify key words that are
                        relevant to your business. Then we scour the World Wide Web to look for what words are thrown up often on search
                        engines. We then create a shortlist of these words and use them in content so that when a search query is made the
                        chances of your website appearing at the top of the result page are high. We follow a structured approach as follows

                            designed for SEO? Are all your unwanted web pages removed? Are there any duplicate pages on your website? Have you
                            indexed your website adequately? Are your keywords not performing efficiently? We go into details in a technical audit
