                             Reputation management has always been vital for healthcare professionals. Bedside manner, patient word of mouth, and
                            reputation among your colleagues all factor into your medical practice’s growth. Building the career, business, and
                            practice you want has always meant building and maintaining a positive reputation.

                        Your online reputation doesn’t always go hand in hand with your real-life patients’ perception, though. Offline, your
                        reputation grows as a direct result of the care you provide to patients in your office. Online, your reputation can take
                        on a life of its own due to the multitude of outlets patients now have to rate, review and discuss the care you provide.
                        That’s why you need to reach out and take control of your online reputation, or it might end up controlling your
                        practice.

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> Patients talk. They always have, and they always will. If your patients love the medical care and the personal attention
                        you provide, you can bet their friends and family are going to hear about it—and if they have a negative experience,
                        they’ll be talking about that, too. These days, though, many of those conversations will happen on social media instead
                        of in person, with more than a third of people in the US saying they already use social media to gather healthcare
                        information.

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> Today’s patients also go a whole lot further than simply asking their friends for doctor recommendations. Those
                        recommendations are just starting points for the research patients do via search engines and healthcare-oriented
                        websites. Before they contact your office, they’re likely to look for other reviews, to learn more about your background
                        and your medical practice, and to see if your online profiles provide a sense of transparency and help build trust. An
                        online reputation that helps build trust helps you acquire more patients, plain and simple.

                        
                        <br/><br/>


                    <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> It makes perfect sense, too, whether you’re selecting a doctor, a restaurant, or an auto mechanic. Given the choice of
                    three providers, all recommended by friends, would you choose the one with a shaky online reputation, the one with
                    limited online presence, or the one with plenty of available information and outstanding reviews?

                   <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> In fact, a study conducted led to a 5-9% revenue boost. For healthcare professionals, ensuring you have a strong profile
                with a positive rating not only on the right mix of social platforms but on other relevant portals can be a major boost
                to your practice.
                   <br/><br/>

                <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> Ensuring that your profiles and your reputation on these sites reflect how you want patients to view you and your
                medical practice is an essential part of modern patient acquisition.

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> The benefits of actively managing your online reputation don’t end with direct patient acquisition. Not only are you
                        more likely to compare favorably to other doctors with a strong online reputation, but you’re more likely to be found in
                        the first place.

                        <br/><br/>

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> Google and other search engines read the web just like patients. Well, not just like patients, but they use a set of
                        algorithms to determine which doctor offices and specialists patients are most likely to engage with. Those algorithms
                        examine the same things patients examine—how complete your online profiles are, your reviews and ratings, how many other
                        reputable healthcare sites point back to your doctor’s office website, and what people are saying about you online.

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color: "red"}}></i> All of that information determines which medical practices, clinics, and hospitals are shown at the top of search
                        results, and which are relegated to the search result pages no one ever sees (it depends on who you ask, but fewer than
                        10% of patients will ever go past the first page of search results—that’s the first ten results!). So managing your
                        online reputation not only ensures you have a better chance of acquiring new patients when they look you up, it also
                        means you have a better chance of patients learning about you when they don’t have a referral.
