                        telecommunications.

                        <i className="bi bi-check-circle " style={{color:" red"}}></i> Social media today is represented by brands such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google, Wechat and
                        Pinterest. All these brands offer platforms using web-based technologies through which users can communicate in real
                        time instantly. They can share any kind of information in the form of text messages, data, audio messages, videos and
                        comments.

                        is mind boggling as evidenced by the staggering penetration achieved by social media companies. These are the four
                        companies that have over 2 billion users. There are other companies which have between 300 million and 900 million
                        users.

                        promote products and services to them. Social media marketing is the process by which marketers use social media to
                        market products and services to users of various social media platforms. The process of conventional marketing undergoes
                        change because of the peculiar nature of the web-based technologies used by social media platforms.
                        The unique feature of social media marketing is the involvement of the customers or users of social media in an
                        interactive process often on a real time basis. This is vastly different from mass media where the communication is
                        one-sided. Another feature of social media marketing is the predominance of user-generated content. This is akin to a
                        description of democracy as “by the people, of the people, for the people.” The body of users of social media create and
                        share content amongst themselves with stimuli coming from marketers of products and services.

                        high usage of social media platforms. Marketers can ignore the power of social media at their own peril.

                                 Since social media platforms provide an opportunity for users to connect with others through a variety of communication
                                channels, often in real time users tend to exchange all kinds of information. These exchanges could also involve the
                                users’ experience of your clinic’s services or your competitors’ services. Thus, it makes sense to promote your clinic
                                to these users and gain new customers for your clinic. Further, if you don’t engage in social media marketing you may
                                lose out on perception of your clinic amongst users. If the experience is good then you are missing out on leveraging
                                the goodwill. If the experience is bad then you are missing an opportunity to isolate these and take corrective action.
